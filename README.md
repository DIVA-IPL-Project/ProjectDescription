Epidemiological studies, as of SARS-CoV-2 or E. coli strains, pose challenges to computer engineering given the volume of data and the heterogeneity of tools and systems. This project aims to develop an integrated, scalable and innovative solution in terms of data integration and visualization, in accordance with the needs of the industry.

The repository (https://github.com/DIVA-IPL-Project/phytotree) contains a library for interactive analysis and visualization of phylogenetic data, easily integrated into any phylogenetic inference framework, as well as providing a cross-platform JavaScript application for the purpose of exemplifying this integration (Vaz C. , et al 2022).

The repository (https://github.com/DIVA-IPL-Project/FLOWViZ) contains a framework that allows the interconnection, through well-defined contracts, phylogenetic inference frameworks to workflow systems. In this way, the user is given the freedom to build their personalized workflows, using the framework and user tools, provided remotely, which can be managed through an intuitive interface (Lu√≠s M. & Vaz C. , 2022).

PhyloDiff (https://github.com/DIVA-IPL-Project/phylodiff) is a library that extends Phylo.io and is suitable for users to efficiently compare a pair of two phylogenetic trees. Another feature of this library is the ability to easily add new comparison measures to it, by providing an object to it, with mandatory and non-mandatory properties.

**All these projects were developed in the context of IPL/2021/DIVA_ISEL.**
